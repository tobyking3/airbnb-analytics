# airbnb-analytics

The website has not yet been hosted and therefore requires the dev server to be spun up on a local machine.

    Please follow these steps to ensure the application can be run:

    1)  Node.js must first be installed on the machine.
        To check if node is installed enter `node -v` in the command line.
        
        If it is not installed, please see - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

    2)  NPM must also be installed.
        To check if NPM is installed, enter `npm -v` in the command line.

        If it is not installed, enter `npm install npm@latest -g` in the command line.

    3)  Please copy the project from the memory stick onto your machine.

    4)  From within the command line, navigate to the project. Example - `cd Documents/airbnb-analytics/`
        Ensure that you are within the top level of the `airbnb-analytics` directory.
    
    5)  Run `npm install`

    6)  Run `npm start`
        This should automatically open the browser on localhost:8080 displaying the website.
        If not, please open chrome and type localhost:8080 in the address bar.
