            Use the drop-down list above to select a London borough of interest, and then hoover over the bar chart to find out the average price per night according to the number of beds within a property.

            The average price typically increases for properties listed with a larger number of beds. On some occasions, where the property count is low, and the rates are high, the averages do not reflect this pattern.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
            Properties listed with more than 6 beds tend to be more unique and as a result, the price difference can vary dramatically.
